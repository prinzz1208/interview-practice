 sorting algorithm is said to be stable if two objects with equal keys appear in the same order in the sorted output as they appear in the unsorted input. Whereas a sorting algorithm is said to be unstable if there are two or more objects with equal keys which don't appear in same order before and after sorting. sorting algorithm is said to be stable if two objects with equal keys appear in the same order in the sorted output as they appear in the unsorted input.
